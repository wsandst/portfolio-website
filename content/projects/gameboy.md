description: "<a href=\"/gameboy/\"> Try out the emulator online here! </a> <br> CorrodedBoy is a Gameboy (DMG) Emulator written in Rust. It has two frontends, one available on the Web using WebAssembly and the other using SDL2. It implements the Gameboy CPU, memory, graphics and audio hardware and allows for most Gameboy games to be played. The emulator passes most of Blarggs CPU tests as well as other tests, but is not completely cycle accurate. "
aim: "The aim of this project was to understand the Gameboy hardware architecture in detail and how to emulate it properly, as well as to learn Rust and compiling it to WebAssembly."
